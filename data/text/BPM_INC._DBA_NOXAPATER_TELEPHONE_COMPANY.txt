NETWORK TRANSPARENCY DATA REQUEST 

Although ISPs are no longer subjected to prohibitions on practices such as blocking or throttling, they 
are now required to disclose which of the following practices they are engaged in.  To the extent that 
you engage in the following practices, please explain your practice.  This will allow JSI to establish a 
favorable description of your practices.  If you do not engage in the practice, indicate “No.” JSI 
recommends that the ISP make a definitive statement that it does not engage in a practce. 

Blocking. Practice that blocks or otherwise 
prevents access to lawful content, applications, 
service or non-harmful devices. Please provide 
description of what is blocked. 

Throttling. Practice of degrading or impairing 
access to lawful traffic on basis of content, 
application, service, user, or use of a non-harmful 
device. Please provide description of what is 
throttled. 
Affiliate Prioritization. Practice favoring some 
traffic over other traffic to the benefit of an 
affiliate.   Please provide a description of the use 
of any techniques such as traffic shaping, 
prioritization, or other resource reservation.  
Please identify the affiliate receiving the benefit. 
Paid Prioritization. Practice favoring some traffic 
over other traffic in exchange for consideration, 
monetary or otherwise.  Please describe the use 
of any techniques such as traffic shaping 
prioritization or other resource reservation. 
Congestion Management.  Describe congestion 
management practices, if any.  Include the types 
of traffic subject to the practices, purposes 
served by the practices, practices’ effects on end 
user’ experience, criteria used in practices.  
Indicate things triggering a practice including 
usage limits, typical frequency of congestion, 
consequences of exceeding thresholds.  Provide 
engineering standards. How often do you 
monitor traffic/connections? 
Application-Specific Behavior. Whether and why 
ISP blocks or rate-controls specific protocols or 
protocol ports, modifies protocol fields in ways
