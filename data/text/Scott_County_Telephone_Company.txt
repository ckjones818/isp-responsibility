Network Management Practices, Performance Characteristics and 

Commercial Terms and Conditions for Fixed Services 

 

 

 
Scott County Telephone Company (“Scott County” or “the Company”) provides this Network 
Transparency Statement in accordance with the FCC’s Restore Internet Freedom Rules to ensure that 
customers have sufficient information to make informed choices about the purchase of broadband 
services. 
 
Scott County engages in network management practices that are tailored and appropriate for achieving 
optimization on the network considering the particular network architecture and technology of its 
broadband Internet access service.  Scott County’s goal is to ensure that all of its customers experience a 
safe and secure broadband Internet environment that is fast, reliable and affordable. 
 
Scott County’s network management includes congestion- and security-protocol-management and 
customers generally will not be impacted by the protocols and practices that the Company uses to 
manage its network. 
 
Network Management Practices 

•  No Blocking, Throttling, Affiliated Prioritization, or Paid Prioritization.  Scott County does not 

block or throttle lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices, subject to 
reasonable network management.  Scott County also does not prioritize certain internet traffic 
over other traffic, paid or otherwise. 

 
•  Congestion Management.  Congestion is an Internet access service problem that can slow web 

browsing and other online activities during certain peak usage periods.  Congestion may be 
caused by capacity limits and bottlenecks in a service provider’s own network, or by limitations 
in the capacity of the transport facilities and services that many rural service providers must 
purchase from unrelated entities to carry the traffic of their customers between their service 
areas and the closest Internet nodes.  Scott County has experienced no recent problems with 
congestion.  If significant congestion problems arise in the future, the Company’s approach is to 
determine the source of the problem, and to increase the capacity of the affected portions of its 
network and/or of its middle-mile routes where warranted.  In the event of congestion, all 
internet service speeds are classified as best effort. 

 

•  Application-Specific Behavior.  Scott County does not favor or inhibit certain applications or 

classes of applications.  Customers may use any lawful and commercially available application 
which they desire on the Company’s network.  Scott County does not normally monitor the 
contents of the traffic or applications of its customers.  It undertakes no obligation to monitor or 
investigate the lawfulness of the applications used by its customers.  If any party contacts the 
Company with a substantial allegation that an application being used by a customer is unlawful, 
the Company will investigate the matter (including consultation, as it deems appropriate, with 
attorneys, consultants, federal or state regulators, and/or federal, state or local law 
enforcement agencies), and will take appropriate action as needed.  Scott County does not block 
or rate-control specific protocols or protocol ports, nor does it modify protocol fields in ways 
that are not prescribed by the applicable protocol standards. 

 

 

•  Device Attachment Rules.  Customers may use devices of their choice (PC, smartphones, tablets, 
smart TV, etc.) to connect to Scott County internet access service via the wiring at their home or 
business premises, or via Wi-Fi connected to their broadband internet access service 
(connection options vary based on device capabilities). 

•  Security.  Scott County employs commercially appropriate security procedures to protect its 
network and its customer records from unauthorized access by third parties.  The Company 
does not guarantee that it can protect customers from any and/or all security breaches. 
 
The Company does not normally monitor the traffic of its customers, and undertakes no 
obligation to monitor or protect such customer traffic from spam, viruses, denial-of-service 
attacks, or other malicious, unlawful or unwanted activities.  Customers can purchase spam 
filtering and anti-virus software from commercial vendors to meet their needs.   Customers are 
free to obtain anti-spam and/or anti-virus software or services from any source they desire, as 
long as such software or services do not disrupt or degrade the traffic of other Scott County 
customers or harm the network.  A customer that experiences a denial-of-service attack, or 
similar malicious, unlawful or unwanted activity, is urged to notify the Company as soon as 
possible.  Scott County will work with the customer, other service providers, federal and state 
regulators, and/or law enforcement to determine the source of such activity, and to take 
appropriate, and technically and economically reasonable efforts to address the matter. 
 

Performance Characteristics 
Scott County offers Internet access over DSL with speeds of up to 10/1 Mbps.  These speeds are suitable 
for real-time applications such as web-surfing, gaming, and streaming music or video content.  While 
Scott County strives to provide optimal performance, specific performance levels are not guaranteed.  
Performance levels can be affected by several factors, including the number of devices connected at a 
customer’s location and network conditions.  Actual speeds and time delays (latency) may also be 
impacted by the length, capacity and congestion of middle-mile transport facilities between Scott 
County’s service area and the internet nodes.  While the Company’s service is suitable for real-time 
applications, the internet service speeds to which a customer subscribes may impact the efficiency of 
real-time applications. 
 
Commercial Terms 
Scott County offers the following internet packages: 
 

4/1 Mbps with Unlimited Usage: 
10/1 Mbps with Unlimited Usage: 

$39.99 
$49.99 

 
Prices do not include applicable taxes.  Not all speeds and services are available in all areas.  There is no 
contract required for Internet services; however, customers must maintain an active and current phone 
line with Scott County Telephone Company.  
 

 

Internet Customer Privacy Policy 
Protecting customer privacy is important to Scott County Telephone Company.  Scott County does not 
collect, store or use traffic information to profile its customers in order to sell additional services to 
them, or for similar non-network management purposes.  The Company retains and stores certain traffic 
information (such as the identity of the customer using a particular IP address during a specific period) 
for time periods required by federal or state law.  Scott County retains, stores and provides to law 
enforcement any traffic information requested pursuant to the procedures of the Communications 
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”), the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) or other 
applicable national security or criminal statutes.
